# Let's get to `!equip`ing! 
This is a [workshop](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/6141842f0c965093d826c235/) on [Avrae's Dashobard](https://avrae.io/dashboard/workshop/).
You can PM me if you have any questions, but I prefer you use the [GitHub](https://github.com/Adalbar3333/Lets_get_to_Equiping/) to report an issue.

### Basic Information 
This alias is a tool for DM's and Players alike to add Weapons and Armor to their characters and monsters. <br>
Say your character grabs an Orc's Greataxe, but does not have one in their inventory, well now you can add it.<br>
Say you want to have a goblin in magical full plate wielding a Glaive, well now you can! 

## `!equip`
### Equiping Weapons
This is a DM's, and Players tool to set up weapons that a monster generally does not have. For example, with !equip, you can have a goblin with a Flame Tongue!
### Homebrew svar for Weapons
```!svar homebrewWeapon
[{
    "name":"Frostbrand",
    "dice": "2d6 [cold] + 1d8",
    "THDice": "2d6 [cold] + 1d10",
    "damage": "slashing",
    "prof": "Martial",
    "type": "Melee",
    "desc": "Versatile (1d10)"
}]
```
Additionally, you can create a GVAR and put the GVAR code in the svar instead:
```!svar homebrewWeapon Insert-Gvar-Code```
### There is only one required argument ->
##### "Weapon Name" | -equip "Weapon Name" | -e "Weapon Name" is used for selecting the weapon you wish to use.
### Additional Arguments:
-t "Target Name" is not so much required, as it will default to your current character. __Initiative Sensitive__.<br>
-i Will ignore proficiency requirements and treat the creature you are giving the weapon to as proficient.<br>
-b will add bonus to hit. __Supports Dice__ <br>
-d will add a bonus to damage. __Supports Dice and Damage__ <br>
-mb will add a magical bonus, increasing (or decreasing) the attack and damage Supports Dice and Damage. <br>
-metal | -m will allow you to pick a metal typeing. (silver is the only important one here.) <br>
-name allows you to give the item a name rather than what will be automatically given to it. <br>

## `!equip armor`
### Equipping Armor and Shields
This is a DM's, and Players tool to set up armor and shields that a monster generally does not have. For example, with !equip armor, you can have a goblin in a set of plate mail!
### Homebrew svar for Armor
```!svar homebrewArmor
[{
        "fName":"Dwarvish Plate",
    "armorBonus": "19",
    "dexBonus": "None",
    "strReq":"15",
    "armorType": "Heavy",
    "desc": "This Full set of armor was made by the dwarvish clans of Shea- a mountain village on the border of SchneefÃ¤llt Provence."
}]
```
##### There is only one required argument ->
"Armor Name" | -equip "Armor Name" | -e "Armor Name" is used for selecting the armor you wish to use.
### Additional Arguments:
-t "Target Name" is not so much required, as it will default to your current character. Initiative Sensitive. <br>
-i Will ignore proficiency requirements and treat the creature you are giving the weapon to as proficient. <br>
-b will add a magical bonus to the armor. <br>
-metal | -m will allow you to pick a metal typing. (adamantine is the only important one here.) <br>
-name allows you to give the item a name rather than what will be automatically given to it. <br>

## `!unequip` 
Simply enough, this will unequip an item you chose as long as you are in an inititave. If you are not, it does nothing. 

`!unequip "Item Name"`
This also works for non-item effects as well, so if you put `rage`, you will have your rage removed from you.
